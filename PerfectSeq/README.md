# Perfect Sequence

#### Problem Statement

Given a sequence. Return "Yes" if the sequence is considered a perfect sequence. Otherwise, return "No"

#### Perfect Sequences

A perfect sequence is a sequence such that all of its elements are non-negative integers and the product of all of them is equal to their sum.
For example: [2,2], [1,3,2] and [0,0,0,0] are perfect sequences and [4,5,6] and [0,2,-2] are not perfect sequences. Negative numbers of any kind are not valid in
a perfect sequence

#### Input Format

An array of integers (may not be sorted)

#### Sample Input

[1,3,2]

#### Sample Output

Yes

#### Explanation

1 _ 3 _ 2 = 6 && 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
